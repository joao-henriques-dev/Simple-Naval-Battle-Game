# Simple Naval Battle Game

A minimal, classic Battleship-style game implemented in Python. Place ships, take turns calling coordinates, and try to sink the opponent's fleet.

## About
This repository contains the game logic for a turn-based naval battle. It is intended to be simple, readable, and easy to extend (AI opponent, GUI, networking).

## How to play
- Each player places ships on a hidden grid.
- Players alternate turns calling coordinates (e.g., A5).
- Hits and misses are reported; ships are sunk when all their cells are hit.
- The first player to sink all opponent ships wins.
